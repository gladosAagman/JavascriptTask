const name = "Aagman";
const age = 22;
const message = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(message); 

//String concatenation is the process of joining or combining multiple strings together to create a new string. 

const firstName = "Aagman";
const lastName = "Mehto";
const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
console.log(fullName);
